Slim SEO Pro is a WordPress plugin. Installing it is similar to installing any other WordPress plugin:

- Go to [My Account](https://wpslimseo.com/my-account/) page and download the plugin's `.zip` file.
- In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New** and click the **Upload Plugin** button.
- Select the downloaded `.zip` file to upload and click the **Install Now** button.
- Activate the plugin.

Slim SEO Pro **doesn't** require Slim SEO Free to work. That means you can use Slim SEO Pro separately as an individual plugin, or you can use it with Slim SEO Free.

Slim SEO Pro also works with any SEO plugin such as Yoast SEO, RankMath, SEO Framework, and SEOPress, ...

After installing, go to **Settings > Slim SEO** to access the plugin's settings page.

If you have Slim SEO Free activated, then you'll find Slim SEO Pro under the same menu, but there are more tabs for more features from Slim SEO Free:

Now you need to [add license key](/slim-seo-pro/license/) to use the plugin.
