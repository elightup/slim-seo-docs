title: Writing Assistant
---

The Writing Assistant feature analyzes your content in real-time to help you create SEO-optimized posts and pages. It provides instant feedback on keywords, readability, content structure, and media optimization to improve your search engine rankings.

## Where to Find It

If you use **Slim SEO free**, when you edit a post or a page, you'll see the **Writing Assistant** tab in the **Search Engine Optimization** meta box:

If you don't use **Slim SEO free**, you'll see the **Writing Assistant** meta box instead:

Just a reminder that you can use [Slim SEO Pro](https://wpslimseo.com/products/slim-seo-pro/) with or without Slim SEO free. Both plugins have a different feature set: Slim SEO free has basic SEO features (completed, not half-baked), and Slim SEO Pro has other premium SEO features (which is *not* in Slim SEO free). If you want to have the strength from all features, please install both of them.

## How it works?

The Writing Assistant feature provides suggestions for you to improve your content. These are **opinionated recommendations** only. They are **not** standards or rules that you must follow. Think about it as an assistant that gives you some feedback for your content (that's why we call it *writing assistant*).

## Recommendations

Here are the full list of recommendations that we suggest, each recommendation has an indicator at the title, which lets you know whether you should improve it (orange) or not (green):

Clicking each section title will open the details of that section with explaination or issues that you should improve. Let's dive in each section to see how they work.

### Keywords

The first thing is keywords (see the screenshot above). Slim SEO Pro allows you to enter **multiple keywords** and analyze them against your content.

In the **Keywords** section, enter your target keywords, separate multiple keywords with commas or press Enter. You can mark one keyword as your **Main keyword** using the toggle switch.

For each keyword, the plugin will analyze your content and provide the following feedback:

- Keyword density: count how many times a keyword appear in your content. It's recommended to keep the keyword density between 0.5% and 3%. Lower means that keyword is probably not the topic of the article, and higher usually means spam.
- Does the keyword appear in title, slug, meta description, intro paragraph, headings, and image alt text? These are important places where you should put your keywords, to let people know the topic of the article, and what's it about.

### Media

![Media section](img/media.png)

This section provides feedback about your featured image and images in your post content.

- For the featured image, the plugin will warn you if you forgot to set it
- For images in your post content, the plugin will warn you if you don't set alt text for them

Besides, for each image, the plugin will also analyze some properties and give you feedback on:

- Image dimension: warns you if your images are too large. We use 1920px as a threadhold, which is wide enough for most screens.
- Imaze size: warns you if your images &gt; 2MB. This ensures your images are loaded fast.
- Image filename: warns you if your images contain special characters in file name. You can review this and name files meaningfully, or add keywords if you want. We don't stricly check this.

### Words Count

This section tracks total word count including image alt text. We suggests to write at least 500 words to avoid creating thin content, which is bad for SEO.

### Internal Links

![Internal links](img/internal-links.png)

This section counts internal links to other posts/pages. It's recommended to add internal links to other posts to:

- Help users find related and useful content
- Assist search engines in understanding the context of your content
- Help search engines discover new posts
- And by creating links to other posts, it will increase the link juice and trust of your posts
- Show search engines that you have deep knowledge of the topic, and thus, increase your authority

This is a quick check for internal links only. It's recommended to use [Link Manager](/slim-seo-pro/link-manager/post-links/) module to have more in-depth report for post links, including:

- Internal outbound links: links from this post to other posts
- Internal inbound links: links from other posts to this post
- External outbout links: links from this post to other websites
- [Link suggestions](/slim-seo-pro/link-manager/link-suggestions/): suggest related content to build internal links

### Slug

Slug is an important SEO feature. We check the slug length and suggest keeping slugs under 5 words for better readability. Note that we already check if the slug contains keywords in the **Keywords** section above.

### Readability (English only)

![Readability](img/readability.png)

We also analyze your content and check if it's readable. We use [Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) to measures how easy your content is to read

**Score Ranges**:

- 90-100: Very easy to read
- 80-89: Easy to read
- 70-79: Fairly easy to read
- 60-69: Okay to read
- 50-59: Fairly difficult to read
- 30-49: Difficult to read
- 0-29: Very difficult to read

If your content is difficult to read, we suggest:

- Use shorter sentences for complex topics
- Break up long paragraphs into digestible chunks
- Avoid jargon when possible
- Target a readability score of 60 or higher

### Paragraphs

We also check your paragraphs to make sure they're not too short or not too long, which also affects readibility.

**Recommendations:**

- Minimum 2 sentences per paragraph, otherwise your paragraph will have only 1 sentence, which is awkward.
- Maximum 10 sentences per paragraph, otherwise they'll too long and hard to read.
- Maximum 200 words per paragraph, otherwise they'll too long and hard to read.

Now it's time to create good and useful content!
