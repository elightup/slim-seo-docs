Slim SEO works nicely with most plugins and themes. In some cases, where a plugin or a theme has special settings or SEO-related stuffs, we might need some extra work to make them run together. For that reason, we have added some integration for popular plugins and themes.

## Plugins

### Page builder plugins

For page builder plugins, Slim SEO renders the content built with them and use this content for [meta description](/slim-seo/meta-description-tag/) and [Open Graph](/slim-seo/facebook-open-graph-tags/).

- **Beaver Builder**
- **Breakdance**
- **Bricks Builder**: Bricks has some SEO features built-in like meta tags and Open Graph tags. When using it with Slim SEO, Slim SEO will disables these features and replace them with the features from Slim SEO.
- **Brizy Builder**
- **Divi**
- **Elementor**
- **Oxygen Builder**
- **Zion Builder**

### Multilingual plugins

- [WPML](/slim-seo/integrations/wpml/)
- [Polylang](/slim-seo/integrations/polylang/)
- **TranslatePress**

When using Slim SEO with these plugins, for each post and term in the sitemap, Slim SEO will add `hreflang` for the languages. With this addition, you don't need a separate sitemap for other languages.
